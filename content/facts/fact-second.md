Sport played a huge role in my life.
I spent half of my life trying different disciplines. As a kid, 
I dreamed about being a great football player and for quite a time I was serious about it. 
I could spend my whole day training to become better. But after some years of training,
I decided that it's not the path I want to follow and started to spend more time on my 
computer playing video games and learning the basics of programming.
